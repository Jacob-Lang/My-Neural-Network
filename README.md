# My-Neural-Network
Building my own neural network package with unit tests.

In this project I want to practice writing python packages and unit testing. I am writing my own neural network package - no keras here!
I am including unit tests. I will eventually train the network on the mnist handwritten dataset to see if it works. 

My Neural Network.ipynb contains demonstrations of the package in use. 
The 'jacobnet' directory contains the package itself and 'tests' contains the unit tests.
